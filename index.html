          Does anyone really care about the history
          of Vice City? Probably not.Today it's a city
          run by dealers and weasels. Expensive suits,
          flashy cars and beautiful women are the 
          accessories of millionaires that spend 
          their afternoons in the shade, 
          determining the fate of Vice City's less
          fortunate and waging war on rival drugs 
          barons.Vice City's warm weather may 
          be the only reason anyone would have
          dreamed of inhabiting the place at all. 
          The weather is generally hot and sunny
          all year round with occasional 
          showers and thunderstorms.

          The game is set in 1986 in fictional Vice City,
          which is based heavily on the city of Miami.
          Vice City previously appeared in the 
          original Grand Theft Auto (1997);
          the development team decided to reuse
          the location and incorporate ideas from
          within the studio and the fanbase.

          The beta version of Roblox was created by co-founders David Baszucki
          and Erik Cassel in 2004 under the name DynaBlocks. Baszucki started
          testing the first demos that year. In 2005, the company changed its name
          to Roblox, and it officially launched on September 1, 2006.Roblox is an
          online game platform that sees around 40 million active users per day. The
          majority of players are under 16, but it is also suitable for adults. Roblox
          can be downloaded as an app on iOS and Android devices, and can also be
          played on PC.
